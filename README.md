# about me

As a student programmer, my goal is to continue learning and gain practical experience in the field.

I want to improve my skills and become proficient in a variety of programming languages and technologies. 

I also want to build a portfolio of projects that showcase my abilities and help me stand out in the job market.

In addition, I have a strong interest in open-source software and the benefits it can provide. 

I want to contribute to open-source projects and help improve existing software. 

I believe that working on open-source projects is a great way to learn, collaborate with others, and give back to the community. 

I am eager to join a team of like-minded individuals who share my passion for open-source development and make a positive impact on the world.
